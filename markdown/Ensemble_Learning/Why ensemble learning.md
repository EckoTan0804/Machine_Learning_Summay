# Why ensemble learning?

**wisdom of the crowd** : In many cases you will find that this aggregated answer is better than an expertâ€™s answer.

Similarly, if you aggregate the predictions of a group of predictors (such as classifiers or regressors), you will often get **better** predictions than with the best individual predictor. 

A group of predictors is called an **ensemble**; 

thus, this technique is called **Ensemble Learning**, 

and an Ensemble Learning algorithm is called an **Ensemble method**.

## Explaination

A model‚Äôs generalization error can be expressed as the sum of three very different errors:

### Bias
This part of the generalization error is due to **wrong assumptions**, such as assuming that the data is linear when it is actually quadratic. 
A high-bias model is most likely to **underfit** the training data.

### Variance
This part is due to the model‚Äôs **excessive sensitivity to small variations** in the training data. \
A model with many degrees of freedom (such as a high-degree polynomial model) is likely to have **high variance**, and thus to **overfit** the training data.

### Irreducible Error
This part is due to the **noisiness of the data** itself. 
The only way to reduce this part of the error is to **clean up the data** (e.g., fix the data sources, such as broken sensors, or detect and remove outliers). 

|               | High bias                      | Low bias               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| High variance | something is terribly wrong! üò≠ | Overfitting            |
| Low variance  | Underfitting                   | too good to be true! ü§™ |

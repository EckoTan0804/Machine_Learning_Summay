    "A model‚Äôs generalization error can be expressed as the sum of three very different errors:\n",

    "### Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the generalization error is due to **wrong assumptions**, such as assuming that the data is linear when it is actually quadratic. \n",
    "A high-bias model is most likely to **underfit** the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "This part is due to the model‚Äôs **excessive sensitivity to small variations** in the training data. \\\n",
    "A model with many degrees of freedom (such as a high-degree polynomial model) is likely to have **high variance**, and thus to **overfit** the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Irreducible Error\n",
    "\n",
    "This part is due to the **noisiness of the data** itself. \n",
    "The only way to reduce this part of the error is to **clean up the data** (e.g., fix the data sources, such as broken sensors, or detect and remove outliers). \n",

    "\n",
    "The Random Forest algorithm **introduces extra randomness** when growing trees; instead of searching for the very best feature when splitting a node, it searches for the best feature among a random subset of features. **This results in a greater tree diversity, which (once again) trades a higher bias for a lower variance, generally yielding an overall better model.** üëè\n"
